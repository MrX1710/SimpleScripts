#This is just a bash script test
#To use it against someone you can encrypt the script using shc (shc -f file.sh ) and create
#an executable (you can name it whatever you want) that hides all the code making the script unreadable thus
#impossible to know what does the code do, some will obviously run it depend on different factors
#if you send it to them (name of the executable, the source it came from...etc)
#especially after seeing the menue printed it can leads to trust the script a little more to carry on
#If executed as you may see in the code either you close the terminal manualy clicking on x either you're trapped
#Yes i told you how you can use it but i don't encourage you to use it so
#I'm not a pro, i'm publishing it just in case where it can gives you ideas about how
#you can use bash with different commands
#Do not use it against someone for any reasons especially childish one(revenge, fun..etc)
#This script works only on Linux, to make it works in Windows you'll have to modify the script so that 
#it can matches Windows's commands
